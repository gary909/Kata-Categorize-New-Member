        The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application <br>
        form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.<br>
        <br>
        To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range <br>
        from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.<br>
        <br>
        Input<br>
        <br>
        Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an <br>
        integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.<br>
        <br>
        Output<br>
        <br>
        Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to <br>
        be placed in the senior or open category.<br>
        <br>
        Example<br>
        <br>
        input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]<br>
        output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]<br>
